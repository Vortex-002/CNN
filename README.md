# 🧠 Eczema Classifier – Using AI to Detect Skin Conditions

> Can a computer help detect eczema just by looking at a photo?  
> I tried building a small AI model to explore that.

## 🌱 What's This About?

Eczema is a skin condition that causes red, itchy, inflamed patches — and it’s more common than most people think.  
But getting it checked often requires time, access to a doctor, or even self-awareness.

So, I built an AI tool that can take an image of skin and try to **predict if it shows signs of eczema**.

It’s not perfect. It’s not a diagnosis. But it’s a cool prototype of how tech can support early detection.

## ⚙️ What the AI Actually Does

- Looks at images of skin (with and without eczema)
- Learns patterns using deep learning
- Predicts if a new image shows signs of eczema

I trained it in Google Colab using Python and TensorFlow/Keras — all inside a single notebook.

## 🔍 What’s Inside This Repo

- `eczema_classifier.ipynb` → The full code and training steps
- 📷 Sample images used for testing
- 🧾 A clear, non-technical explanation (this README!)
- ❗ MIT-style disclaimer: This is for learning only, not medical use

## 💡 Why It Matters

In parts of the world where dermatologists aren’t easily accessible,  
a tool like this could be a helpful **early warning system**.

Imagine:
- A simple phone app
- You upload a skin photo
- It tells you: "This might be eczema — consider seeing a doctor"

That’s the vision behind this project.

## 🛠️ Try It Yourself (Coming Soon)

I’ll be adding a step-by-step guide so anyone can upload a photo and see what the AI predicts.  
If you're curious about contributing or testing, feel free to reach out.
